# Alert Triage Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook defines the process for analyzing, validating, and prioritizing security alerts generated by Wazuh and pfSense.

---

## Triage Workflow

### 1. Alert Reception
- Alert received in Wazuh Dashboard
- Identify rule ID and alert category
- Note timestamp and affected asset

---

### 2. Initial Validation
- Check alert severity level
- Confirm if alert is a false positive
- Verify source IP, destination IP, and port
- Identify repetitive or correlated alerts

---

### 3. Context Gathering
- Review host logs
- Check recent authentication attempts
- Analyze firewall logs from pfSense
- Look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

---

### 4. Classification
Classify the alert as:
- False Positive
- Low Risk
- Medium Risk
- High Risk
- Confirmed Incident

---

### 5. Prioritization
- High-risk alerts impacting critical systems are prioritized
- Alerts affecting multiple hosts escalate automatically
- External attack sources are investigated first

---

### 6. Action
- Close alert with documentation
- Escalate to Incident Response Playbook if confirmed
- Tune detection rules if false positive

---

## Tools Used
- Wazuh Dashboard
- pfSense logs
- Linux and Windows system logs

---

## Notes
Proper alert triage reduces SOC fatigue and improves detection accuracy.
