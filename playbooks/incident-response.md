# Incident Response Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook defines the standard process for responding to security incidents detected in the SOC lab using Wazuh and pfSense.

---

## Incident Phases

### 1. Detection
- Alerts generated by Wazuh Manager
- Firewall events from pfSense
- Suspicious behavior from Linux or Windows agents

---

### 2. Identification
- Validate alert severity
- Identify affected host(s)
- Determine attack vector (network, endpoint, credential, malware)

---

### 3. Containment
- Isolate affected host (network or VM snapshot)
- Block malicious IPs on pfSense
- Disable compromised accounts if applicable

---

### 4. Eradication
- Remove malware or malicious processes
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Reset credentials

---

### 5. Recovery
- Restore systems from clean snapshots
- Monitor for recurring indicators
- Re-enable services gradually

---

### 6. Lessons Learned
- Document timeline of the incident
- Update detection rules
- Improve SOC procedures

---

## Tools Used
- Wazuh SIEM
- pfSense Firewall
- Linux & Windows endpoints
- SOC Analyst VM

---

## Notes
This playbook is designed for lab and educational purposes but mirrors real-world SOC operations.
